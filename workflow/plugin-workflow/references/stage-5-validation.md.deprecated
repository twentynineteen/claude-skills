# Stage 5: Validation (DEPRECATED)

**DEPRECATION NOTICE:** This file is deprecated as of 2025-11-14.

## Why Deprecated

Stage 5 (separate validation stage) has been eliminated from the workflow. Validation is now automatic and continuous across all implementation stages (1-3).

## What Changed

**Before (5-stage workflow):**
- Stage 1: Planning
- Stage 2: Foundation
- Stage 3: DSP
- Stage 4: GUI
- Stage 5: Validation (optional, could be skipped)

**After (3-stage workflow with automatic validation):**
- Stage 0: Planning (plugin-planning skill)
- Stage 1: Foundation (with automatic validation after)
- Stage 2: DSP (with automatic validation after)
- Stage 3: GUI (with automatic validation after)
- No separate validation stage - validation is automatic and blocking

## Migration Impact

**For existing plugins:**
- Plugins at Stage 4 or 5: Will be treated as complete (Stage 3 in new system)
- In-progress plugins: Can continue normally, validation runs automatically

**For orchestrator:**
- Dispatcher no longer routes to Stage 4/5
- Validation-agent invoked automatically after each stage (1-3)
- Validation failures with `continue_to_next_stage: false` are BLOCKING

**For users:**
- No separate validation step to remember
- Quality assurance is automatic
- Faster workflow (no separate validation stage)
- Better quality (validation can't be skipped)

## New Validation System

Validation is now handled by enhanced validation-agent:
- Runs automatically after EVERY stage (1-3)
- Performs compile-time checks (contract matching)
- Performs runtime tests (load plugin, process audio, parameter changes)
- BLOCKS workflow if critical failures detected
- Max 500 tokens per report

See `.claude/skills/plugin-workflow/references/validation-integration.md` for current implementation.

## Preset Generation

Factory preset generation was part of Stage 5 and has been removed from the workflow. Presets are now handled by the `/package` command (optional, for distribution).

## Plugin Testing

The plugin-testing skill is no longer invoked by plugin-workflow. Runtime tests are handled directly by validation-agent.
