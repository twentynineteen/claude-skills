description: Validates audio plugins through automated tests, pluginval, or manual DAW testing. Use for MANUAL testing via /test command. Note - Automatic validation now built into workflow (validation-agent runs after each stage). This skill is for manual testing only, after bug fixes, or when user mentions test, validate, validation, pluginval, stability, automated tests, run tests, check plugin, or quality assurance.

# plugin-testing Skill

**Purpose:** Catch crashes, parameter issues, and state bugs in 2 minutes with automated tests.

**IMPORTANT:** Automatic validation is now built into the workflow. validation-agent runs automatically after each implementation stage (Stages 1-3) with compile-time and runtime tests. Validation is blocking - errors must be fixed before progressing.

**This skill is for MANUAL testing only:**
- After completing workflow (via `/test` command)
- After bug fixes (via `/improve`)
- For additional verification beyond automatic validation
- For manual DAW testing workflows

**Was previously invoked by:** plugin-workflow after Stages 3, 4, 5 (DEPRECATED - now handled by validation-agent)

## Workflow Overview

Three test modes: (1) Automated (~2 min), (2) Build + Pluginval (~5-10 min) ⭐ RECOMMENDED, (3) Manual DAW (~30-60 min). See decision menu for details.

## Phase 1: Detect Plugin and Mode Selection

<decision_gate>
**Complete all prerequisite checks before presenting mode selection:**

1. Parse plugin name from user input (from `/test [Name]` or natural language)
2. Read `PLUGINS.md` and verify plugin exists
3. Verify plugin status is NOT 💡 (implementation must exist)
4. Check for Tests/ directory: `test -d "plugins/{PLUGIN_NAME}/Tests/"`

Present mode selection menu (see `assets/decision-menu-templates.md#mode-selection`) and WAIT for user selection (1-4). Do not proceed to Phase 2 until mode selected.
</decision_gate>

**Parse shorthand commands:**
- `/test [PluginName] build` → Jump to Mode 2
- `/test [PluginName] quick` → Jump to Mode 1
- `/test [PluginName] manual` → Jump to Mode 3

## Phase 2: Execute Test Mode

### Mode 1: Automated Testing

**Track your progress:**
```
Mode 1 Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Check for Tests/ directory
- [ ] Step 2: Read test specifications
- [ ] Step 3: Build and execute tests
- [ ] Step 4: Parse test results
- [ ] Step 5: Present results and next steps
```

<critical_sequence>
**Execute these steps in exact order:**

<step id="check_tests">
**Step 1: Check for Tests/ Directory**

Verify Tests/ directory exists:
```bash
test -d "plugins/{PLUGIN_NAME}/Tests/"
```

**VALIDATION GATE**: If Tests/ directory does not exist:
1. Inform user that automated tests require test infrastructure
2. Present decision menu from `assets/decision-menu-templates.md#missing-tests`
3. WAIT for user selection
4. **STOP - Do not proceed to Step 2** (user must select Mode 2 or cancel)

If Tests/ directory exists, proceed to Step 2.

</critical_sequence>

## Phase 3: Failure Investigation (Option 1)

<delegation_rule>
**When user chooses "Investigate failures":**

<sequence>
1. Read `references/troubleshooting.md` for each failed test
2. Provide initial fix recommendations from troubleshooting docs
3. Offer code inspection option

4. **For non-trivial issues:**

   **Non-trivial issues include:**
   - Errors not documented in troubleshooting.md
   - Multiple interconnected test failures (3+ tests failing together)
   - JUCE API-specific problems (APVTS, processBlock, threading)
   - Issues requiring cross-file analysis (DSP + parameters + state management)
   - Platform-specific crashes or validation failures

   <handoff_protocol>
   Delegate to `deep-research` skill via Task tool:

   ```
   Task tool parameters:
   - task: "Investigate [test_name] failure in [PluginName]

     Context:
     - Test failed: [specific failure message]
     - Plugin type: [from creative-brief.md]
     - Relevant code: [file paths from investigation]

     Goal: Find root cause and provide specific fix"
   - subagent_type: "research-planning-agent"
   ```

   After deep-research completes:
   1. Read deep-research return message completely
   2. Verify root cause identified (not just symptoms)
   3. Extract specific fix recommendations
   4. THEN present findings to user with decision menu

   **Never attempt to fix complex issues without delegation to deep-research.**
   </handoff_protocol>
</sequence>
</delegation_rule>

## Phase 4: Log Test Results and Checkpoint

<state_requirement>
**After completing any test mode (1, 2, or 3):**

**Requirement 1: Save Test Log**

Save detailed test log to: `logs/{PLUGIN_NAME}/test_[timestamp].log`

Use format from `assets/report-templates.md#test-log-format`

**Requirement 2: Update .continue-here.md**

Update `.continue-here.md`:
- Set stage: "testing_complete"
- Set next_step based on test results (installation if passed, investigation if failed)
- Record last_tested: [timestamp]
- Record test_mode: [1/2/3]

**Requirement 3: Update PLUGINS.md**

Update `PLUGINS.md` for {PLUGIN_NAME}:
- Set test_status: "✅ passed" or "❌ failed"
- Record last_tested: [date]
- Record test_mode_used: [Mode 1/2/3]

**Requirement 4: Commit Changes**

Commit test results and state updates:
```bash
git add logs/{PLUGIN_NAME}/test_[timestamp].log .continue-here.md PLUGINS.md
git commit -m "test({PLUGIN_NAME}): {test_mode} validation {RESULT}"
```

**Requirement 5: Check Workflow Mode**

Read `.claude/preferences.json` to determine workflow mode:

- If express mode with auto_test=true: Auto-progress to installation (skip decision menu)
- If manual mode OR auto_test=false: Present post-test decision menu (see templates)

**Complete all five requirements before proceeding.**

**Error Handling**: If any requirement fails (file write error, missing plugin entry), report the specific error to the user and abort state update. Do not present the decision menu with incomplete state.

VERIFY all state files updated and committed successfully before presenting next steps.
</state_requirement>

## Success Criteria

Testing is successful when:

- ✅ Tests run without crashes (even if some fail, process completes)
- ✅ All tests pass OR failures are documented with clear explanations
- ✅ User understands what failed and why (no mystery errors)
- ✅ Logs saved for future reference (`logs/[PluginName]/`)
- ✅ User knows next step (install, fix issues, continue workflow)
- ✅ Test results stored in PLUGINS.md (test date, pass/fail, mode used)

**NOT required for success:**

- 100% pass rate (failures are learning opportunities)
- Fixing all issues immediately (user can defer fixes)
- Running all 3 test modes (one mode is sufficient for validation)

## Integration Points

**Invoked by:**

**Commands:**
- `/test [PluginName]` → Mode selection menu
- `/test [PluginName] build` → Direct to Mode 2 (pluginval)
- `/test [PluginName] quick` → Direct to Mode 1 (automated)
- `/test [PluginName] manual` → Direct to Mode 3 (DAW testing)

**Skills:**
- `plugin-improve` → After implementing bug fixes or features
- ~~`plugin-workflow`~~ → DEPRECATED (now uses validation-agent for automatic testing)

**Natural Language:**
- "Test [PluginName]"
- "Run validation on [PluginName]"
- "Check [PluginName] for crashes"

**Note:** For workflow implementation testing, validation-agent runs automatically after each stage. This skill is only needed for manual testing outside the workflow.

**Invokes:**

- `deep-research` skill → When user chooses "Investigate failures"

**Creates:**

- Test logs in `logs/{PLUGIN_NAME}/test_[timestamp].log`
- Build artifacts in `build/plugins/{PLUGIN_NAME}/`

**Updates:**

- `.continue-here.md` → Testing checkpoint
- `PLUGINS.md` → Test status
